              Built into the heart of the community, the tri-level Leisure Club
              is positioned as The Bay Club’s primary differentiator. Below is a
              modern, marketing-ready structure that you can populate with final
              program details, hours, and membership terms.

                  residents swim laps while snow falls outside. Adjacent spa
                  features (whirlpool, sauna, steam) can be listed here with
