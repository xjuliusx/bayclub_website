Place the basketball image file named `basketball.jpg` in this folder so pages reference it locally.

If you have the image URL, you can run this from the repo root (macOS / Linux):

```bash
curl -L -o images/layouts/basketball.jpg "<IMAGE_URL>"
```

Or drop the file here using your editor or file manager.
