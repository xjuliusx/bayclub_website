              The Bay Club sits in the Bay Terrace section of Bayside, Queens—a
              quiet pocket near the Throgs Neck Bridge that still offers quick
              access to Manhattan, Long Island and the rest of the borough. This
              page reframes the existing location copy into a clearer,
              prospect-ready story.
